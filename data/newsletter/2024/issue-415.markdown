Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Dyadic Decomposition using Functional lenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG4qVQpCeDQ) by Eduardo Lemos
  > Compressors are usually implemented imperatively. Pointers and mutation are in the spotlight and it is not hard to put yourself into some spaghetti code. How functional programming abstractions deal with it? In this presentation, I explain one instance in which some of them fit like a glove to the problem on hand, going all the way from intuition to actual code.
  
- [Extracting curve coordinates from a bitmap](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2024/04/08/extracting-curve-coordinates-from-a-bitmap/) by Mark Seemann
  > As I already mentioned in the previous article, these days there are online tools for just about everything. Most likely, there's also an online tool that will take a bitmap like that and return a set of (x, y) coordinates. Since I'm doing this for the programming exercise, I'm not interested in that. Rather, I'd like to write a little Haskell script to do it for me.

- [Haskell Security Response Team - 2024 January–March report](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-security-response-team-2024-january-march-report/9285) by Fraser Tweedale
  > The Haskell Security Response Team (SRT) is a volunteer organisation within the Haskell Foundation that is building tools and processes to aid the entire Haskell ecosystem in assessing and responding to security risks. In particular, we maintain a database of security advisories that can serve as a data source for security tooling.

- [PenroseKiteDart User Guide](https://readerunner.wordpress.com/2024/04/08/penrosekitedart-user-guides/) by Chris Reade
  > PenroseKiteDart is a Haskell package with tools to experiment with finite tilings of Penrose’s Kites and Darts. It uses the Haskell Diagrams package for drawing tilings. As well as providing drawing tools, this package introduces tile graphs (`Tgraphs`) for describing finite tilings.
  
- [Solving Advent of Code ’23 “Aplenty” by Compiling](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/compiling-aoc23-aplenty/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > Every year I try to solve some problems from the Advent of Code (AoC) competition in a not straightforward way. Let’s solve the part one of the day 19 problem Aplenty by compiling the problem input to an executable file.
  
- [Stackage Handover Complete](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/stackage-handover-complete/9252) by Bryan Richter
  > I’m happy to announce the completion of the handover of Stackage.org to the Haskell Foundation.
