Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

<!-- Runs on June 13, 20 & 27. Copy changes week to week. -->

- [Announcing a free video-based Haskell introduction course](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/06/announcing-free-haskell-intro-course/) by Andres Löh
  > I am happy to be able to announce that starting today and continuing over the next few weeks, we are going to make the materials that our "Introduction to Haskell" course is based on available for free

- [Failing at Combinatorics with Haskell](https://two-wrongs.com/failing-at-combinatorics-with-haskell.html) by kqr
  > I stumbled across Jezen Thomas article on Solving a Maths Riddle with Bad Haskell recently. I was interested in what some solutions might look like when parentheses are used, but I didn't want to fiddle with parentheses.

- [Haskell inline-c Demo For Pipewire](https://tristancacqueray.github.io/blog/haskell-inline-c-pipewire#test) by Tristan de Cacqueray
  > This post shows how I created a high level, proof of concept, Haskell binding for the libpipewire using inline-c. The goal is to demonstrate how to implement a Pipewire client with Haskell.

- [Implement Authentication using JWT in Servant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mft1OheTQJ0) by Purely Haskell
  > Secure your Haskell applications with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using the Servant framework! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of implementing authentication in Haskell, leveraging JWT for secure and stateless user sessions. You'll learn how to set up and configure Servant for handling authentication, create JWT tokens, and manage user sessions effectively.

- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 27: duality](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/06/haskell-unfolder-episode-27-duality/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > "Duality" is the idea that two concepts are "similar but opposite" in some precise sense. The discovery of a duality enables us to use our understanding of one concept to help us understand the dual concept, and vice versa. It is a powerful technique in many disciplines, including computer science. In this episode of the Haskell Unfolder we discuss how we can use duality in a very practical way, as a guiding principle leading to better library interfaces and a tool to find bugs in our code. This episode focuses on design philosophy rather than advanced Haskell concepts, and should consequently be of interest to beginners and advanced Haskell programmers alike (we will not use any Haskell beyond Haskell 2010). Indeed, the concepts apply in other languages also (but we will assume familiarity with Haskell syntax).

- [Working towards a more stable Template Haskell](https://informal.codes/posts/stabilising-th/) by Teo Camarasu
  > This post is about some work I have been doing with Sebastian Graf and other GHC devs to help avoid Template Haskell breaking user's code in the future. This is a well known problem (see GHC ticket #24021). There is no simple, single solution. Both the API and its patterns of usage are complex.
