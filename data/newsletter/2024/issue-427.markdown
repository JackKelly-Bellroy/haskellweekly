Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Announcing Haddock Dingus, a tool for previewing Haddock markup](https://taylor.fausak.me/2024/07/01/haddock-dingus/) by Taylor Fausak
  > I’ve often wanted a web-based tool for previewing what some Haddock will look like. Over the weekend I put one together. I call it the Haddock Dingus, after the original Markdown Dingus. It’s pretty simple: Input some Haddock, click “Submit”, and see what the output HTML looks like. Give it a whirl and let me know what you think!

- [Cabal-install-3.12.1.0 (and accompanying libraries) released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/cabal-install-3-12-1-0-and-accompanying-libraries-released/9830) by Artem Pelenitsyn
  > The cabal release team brings you the release of the `cabal-install` tool, version 3.12.1.0. This is the first release of the tool in the 3.12 series, and, hence, the first `cabal-install` supporting Cabal 3.12 packaged with GHC 9.10.1. We also update the three main libraries.
  
- [Episode 52 – Pepe Iborra](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/52/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Andres and Sam interview Pepe Iborra, exploring his journey from academia via banking to now Meta. In this episode, we discuss Pepe’s involvement in the evolution of the Haskell ecosystem, in particular the ongoing journey to improve the developer experience via work on debuggers, build systems and IDEs.
  
- [GHCi in the Browser](https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2024/07/03/ghci-in-the-browser/) by Vaibhav Sagar
  > I’m happy to announce that you can now run GHCi entirely in your browser.
  
- [ICFP Contest 2024 - Pure Laziness Report](https://tristancacqueray.github.io/blog/icfpc2024) by Tristan de Cacqueray
  > The International Conference on Functional Programming Programming Contest is a three days annual event. This post is my participation report.
  
- [Lensy Moore](https://blog.cofree.coffee/2024-07-02-lensy-moore/) by Solomon
  > How far can we get leveraging the lens library in Haskell to model Moore Machines and Wiring Diagrams?
  
- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 28: type families and overlapping instances](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/07/haskell-unfolder-episode-28-type-families-and-overlapping-instances/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > In this episode, we discuss a programming technique which allows us to replace overlapping instances with a decision procedure implemented using type families. The result is a bit more verbose, but arguably clearer and more flexible.
  
- [The LAST DevOps weekly log, 2024-06-27](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/the-last-devops-weekly-log-2024-06-27/9816) by Bryan Richter
  > The reason for the change is that the HF DevOps role is being reduced to a 20%-time contract. Nobody wanted this change to happen, but the economics of the software industry simply don’t support a full-time (or even 80%-time), sponsorship-funded, purely-technical role for Haskell right now.
  
- [The sad state of property-based testing libraries](https://stevana.github.io/the_sad_state_of_property-based_testing_libraries.html) by stevan
  > In this post I’d like to survey the most popular property-based testing implementations and compare them with what used to be the state-of-the-art fifteen years ago (2009). As the title already gives away, most of the libraries do not offer their users the most advanced property-based testing features. In order to best explain what’s missing and why I think we ended up in this situation, let me start by telling the brief history of property-based testing.
  
- [Things that I've 3D Printed Using Haskell](https://www.doscienceto.it/blog/posts/2024-06-30-things-ive-3d-printed-in-haskell.html) by Joe Warren
  > Last year, I released a library for doing Programmable CAD in Haskell, called Waterfall-CAD. I’ve written about that library before, but now that I’ve had a chance to actually use it to design some things, I wanted to post about my experience making them.

- [Seeking hasktags maintainer](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/seeking-hasktags-maintainer/9856) by Jack Henahan
  > In short, I’ve been doing a really terrible job keeping the lights on and I don’t foresee a lot of additional bandwidth in the near term. I haven’t used it actively since the LSP options became usable, but I know there are people who do. Please reach out if you have any interest.
