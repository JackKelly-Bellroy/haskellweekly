Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haddock now lives in the GHC repository](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haddock-now-lives-in-the-ghc-repository/9576) by Hécate Moonlight
  > Today, the migration of the Haddock documentation generation program to live in the GHC repository has been finalised, with great help from @bgamari.
  
- [Haskell, Lean, Idris, and the Art of Writing](https://www.typetheoryforall.com/episodes/haskell-lean-idris-and-the-art-of-writing-1) by David Christiansen
  > In this episode we talk with David Christiansen, he wrote the books Functional Programming in Lean and the Little Typer. He has also worked as the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation, at Galois and did his PhD developing a bunch of cool stuff for Idris.
  
- [Hyperbole - Interactive HTML applications with type-safe serverside Haskell. Like typed HTMX](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-hyperbole-interactive-html-applications-with-type-safe-serverside-haskell-like-typed-htmx/9607) by Sean Hess
  > When I released web-view 6 months ago, I said I was “weeks” away from releasing a framework for interactive web apps built on top of it. Well it’s been 26 weeks, and it’s finally ready!
  
- [Live Reloading Haskell GUI From Scratch](https://tristancacqueray.github.io/blog/live-reloading-haskell-gui-from-scratch#) by Tristan de Cacqueray
  > This post shows how to setup a live reloading workflow to develop graphical user interfaces (GUI) with Haskell on Fedora Linux from scratch.
  
- [Prefer do notation over Applicative operators when assembling records](https://www.haskellforall.com/2024/05/prefer-do-notation-over-applicative.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This is a short post explaining why you should prefer do notation when assembling a record, instead of using Applicative operators (i.e. (<$>)/(<*>)).
  
- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 26: variable-arity functions](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/05/haskell-unfolder-episode-26-variable-arity-functions/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > In this episode, we will take look at how one can use Haskell’s class system to encode functions that take a variable number of arguments, and also discuss some examples where such functions can be useful.
